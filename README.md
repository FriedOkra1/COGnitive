## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite (fast development & build)
- Tailwind CSS
- Axios for API calls

**Backend:**
- Node.js with Express
- TypeScript
- OpenAI API (GPT-4o-mini & Whisper)
- Multer for file uploads
- pdf-parse, mammoth for document processing

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- OpenAI API key (get one at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- npm or yarn package manager

## Setup Instructions

### Quick Start (Recommended)

From the root directory:

```bash
# 1. Create backend .env file with your OpenAI API key
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here" > backend/.env
echo "PORT=3001" >> backend/.env
echo "NODE_ENV=development" >> backend/.env

# 2. Install all dependencies (both frontend and backend)
npm run install:all

# 3. Start both frontend and backend servers
npm run dev
```

Both servers will start automatically:
- Backend: `http://localhost:3001`
- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to run frontend and backend separately:

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here" > .env
echo "PORT=3001" >> .env
echo "NODE_ENV=development" >> .env
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Frontend (in a new terminal):**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Open in Browser

Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to use the app!

## Security Note

IMPORTANT: Your OpenAI API key was posted publicly in the chat. Please:

1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Revoke the exposed API key
3. Create a new API key
4. Update your `backend/.env` file with the new key
5. Never commit `.env` files to git (already in `.gitignore`)

## Available Commands

From the root directory:

- `npm run install:all` - Install dependencies for both frontend and backend
- `npm run dev` - Start both frontend and backend in development mode
- `npm run dev:backend` - Start only the backend server
- `npm run dev:frontend` - Start only the frontend server
- `npm run build` - Build both frontend and backend for production
- `npm run clean` - Remove all node_modules and uploaded files

## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
- Make sure `.env` file exists with your OpenAI API key
- Check if port 3001 is already in use
- Run `npm install` again

### Frontend won't connect to backend
- Ensure backend is running on port 3001
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify `VITE_API_URL` in frontend (uses proxy by default)

### Document upload fails
- Check file size (max 10MB for documents)
- Ensure file type is PDF, DOCX, DOC, or TXT
- Check backend logs for errors

### Voice recording doesn't work
- Grant microphone permissions in browser
- Use HTTPS or localhost (required for microphone access)
- Check browser compatibility (Chrome/Edge recommended)
